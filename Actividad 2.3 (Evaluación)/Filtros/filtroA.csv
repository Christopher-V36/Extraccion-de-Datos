My name is Kei.

Thank you for visiting my account!

Let me introduce myself first, 

I used to work in financial field and often went on a business trip in the U.S and some big cities in Asia.
My business went pretty well, but it was such an intensive work. I was always under huge pressure, especially during the business trip. So, on my business trip, I mostly preferred staying at Airbnb than hotels as I could put myself in relaxing and comfortable situation that I felt like I was at home. 

Through my Airbnb experience, I got a glimpse of new other culture while talking to the owner of the Airbnb and other guests. This experience was unforgettable for me, and I got interested in communication with people in other culture.

Recently, I’ve settled down my life here in Tokyo, then, decided to be an Airbnb host to welcome people from all over the world. 

In order for you to feel “Real Japan Life”, I carefully chose furniture and household items in my apartment. 

Hope you will like my apartment and have a great time in Tokyo!

Thank you.

My name is Keisuke.
I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
And last year, I visited France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
Hopefully I will visit other beautiful places this year.
I might stay with some of you when I go visit your place :)

I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.

I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
